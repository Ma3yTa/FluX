* toSequence (see Performance.fsx): Provide a more convenient way
* inlin building block functions - does it matter?


* Building blocks:
    * ramp
    * ringBuffer
    * flipFlop
    * hysteresis
    * follower
    * HP/LP/BP/Comb
    * ADSR
    * bitCrusher
    * chorus
    * flanger
    * phaser
    * reverb
    * saturator
    * DFT/FFT
    * sampler

* Voices (concept)
* Control rate (for LFOs)
* don't auto-open modules. Use extensions instead?
